Introduction
---

Theraot.Core is as close as I am to a ".NET Compatibility Pack" capable to bring code from recent .NET versions back to .NET 3.5.

Please refer to the Wiki for more information.

Build

The compiling configuration has been set for ease of batch building from Visual Studio, building from Xamarin Studio is also supported.

The solution can also be built from `build.bat`, which is also used to create the NuGet Package.
