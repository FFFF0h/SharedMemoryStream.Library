-----

The SharedMemoryStream class library provides a set of C# classes that utilise memory mapped files for fast low-level inter-process communication (IPC) - specifically for sharing data between processes.

The library uses the .NET 4 MemoryMappedFile class in .NET 4.0+, and implements its own wrapper class for .NET 3.5.
